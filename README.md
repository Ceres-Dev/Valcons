# Valcons
Default icons used in Valence

<img src="https://github.com/ProjectValence/Valcons/blob/main/readme/Icons%20Showcase.png" />

These icons were designed from scratch using Figma. These icons take inspiration from the [Material Icon Theme](https://github.com/PKief/vscode-material-icon-theme) as 
well as the [Monokai Pro](https://monokai.pro) Icon theme. Right now, there is only a small number of icons for different files but I will add more in the future.
